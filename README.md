# Tailwind CSS Responsive Modifier Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a bug related to unexpected behavior when using nested responsive modifiers and conflicting utility classes within Tailwind CSS. The bug manifests as incorrect or missing styles at specific viewport sizes due to conflicts between responsive modifiers and other Tailwind classes. 

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when multiple responsive modifiers are applied in conjunction with other utility classes that affect the same CSS properties. This can lead to unpredictable styling results, where certain styles are overridden or ignored, particularly in more complex layouts. The provided example demonstrates this issue with inconsistent spacing and text alignment based on screen size.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the order and specificity of Tailwind classes.  Sometimes, more specific modifiers need to be used to ensure the correct style is applied.  In other cases, re-structuring the HTML or CSS to reduce ambiguity in Tailwind class application can solve the problem.  In this example, improving specificity and separating the responsive modifiers resolved the layout conflicts.
