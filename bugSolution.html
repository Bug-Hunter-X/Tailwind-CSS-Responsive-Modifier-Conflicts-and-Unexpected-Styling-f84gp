The solution involves using more specific classes and potentially restructuring the HTML to avoid ambiguous situations. By clearly separating the application of different utility classes and ensuring responsive modifiers are correctly prioritized, the conflicting styles are resolved. 
This example demonstrates how rewriting the HTML with clear separation and using more specific Tailwind classes fixes the layout issues.
```html
<div class="lg:flex lg:space-x-4">
  <div class="p-4 bg-gray-200">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold">Column 1</p>
  </div>
  <div class="p-4 bg-gray-200">
    <p class="text-lg font-bold">Column 2</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
